### Date

17 October 2022

### What I completed today

I worked on the Team Contract and setting it up for the team.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

I was distracted with finding other possible idea's for the software project. A game of some sort might be useful but it could be a waste of time.

### Actions taken

I had to brainstorm some idea's about a game that could be in support of the website.

### Smart goal for the next day

Begin to select collaboration tools appropriate for the team.

### Personal reflection

There was a bit of a delay in the project as we were still trying to come up with an idea for a software project. I think we really need to make decisions early and also communicate a lot between team members.

### Date

19 October 2022

### What I completed today

I completed the draft version of the wireframes for the Ruach Elohim foundation. And sent it to the team for feedback and modifications.

I was a bit lost with what kind of content to put in the wireframes.

I just put placeholder text or lorim ipsum and basic shapes for icons, images and logos.

### Smart goal for the next day

- Get some feedback and begin to modify the wireframes.
- Set up the MongoDB Atlas database for the project

- I modified the wireframes based on Leone's feedback. To include login/account link in the navigation bar.
- Set up the MongoDB Atlas database for the project.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

- I was a little bit distracted with trying to fix my desktop computer as a backup machine just in case my laptop failed. Discovered that the expensive graphics card was dead. So I pulled it out and used the motherboards graphics instead.
- I've started to notice that my laptop is slowing down a lot and will need to prepare my desktop computer for this project.

### Actions taken

Begin transitioning my files over to the desktop and install all the software needed to get up and running.

### Smart goal for the next day

Look again at the assessment and check what else needs to be done.
