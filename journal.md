### Date

17 October 2022

### What I completed today

I worked on the Team Contract and setting it up for the team.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

I was distracted with finding other possible idea's for the software project. A game of some sort might be useful but it could be a waste of time.

### Actions taken

I had to brainstorm some idea's about a game that could be in support of the website.

### Smart goal for the next day

Begin to select collaboration tools appropriate for the team.

### Personal reflection

There was a bit of a delay in the project as we were still trying to come up with an idea for a software project. I think we really need to make decisions early and also communicate a lot between team members.

### Actions taken

Begin transitioning my files over to the desktop and install all the software needed to get up and running.

## 05 Daily Status report 21/10/2022

### Date

21 October 2022

### What I completed today

- I completed the Team Contract
- I completed the draft Wireframes for the landing page

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

- When I was designing the wireframes in Photoshop is was very sluggish and took too long.
- Brayden suggested using Figma and it was a better solution as the whole team can add their changes.

### Actions taken

Decided to move all the wireframes to Figma online app and it was a lot faster to design things.

### Smart goal for the next day

- Begin working on the other page designs for the wireframes
- Begin working on the mockups and look at some colour schemes

### Personal reflection

- Communication is really important and daily stand-up meetings really help with progress.
- What doesn't work well is having to learn something new all the time especially if you have a deadline.
- We were down one team member for a couple of days but what I've learned is, you have embrace change and have knowledge in all areas of a project in order to be flexible.
