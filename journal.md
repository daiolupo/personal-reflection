### What I completed today

I worked on the Team Contract and setting it up for the team.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

### Smart goal for the next day

### Personal reflection

There was a bit of a delay in the project as we were still trying to come up with an idea for a software project. I think we really need to make decisions early and also communicate a lot between team members.

### What I completed today

- I completed the Team Contract
- I completed the draft Wireframes for the landing page

### Personal reflection

- Communication is really important and daily stand-up meetings really help with progress.
