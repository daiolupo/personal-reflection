## 01 Daily Status report 17/10/2022<a name="01daily"></a>

### Date

17 October 2022

### What I completed today

I worked on the Team Contract and setting it up for the team.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

I was distracted with finding other possible idea's for the software project. A game of some sort might be useful but it could be a waste of time.

### Actions taken

I had to brainstorm some idea's about a game that could be in support of the website.

### Smart goal for the next day

Begin to select collaboration tools appropriate for the team.

### Personal reflection

There was a bit of a delay in the project as we were still trying to come up with an idea for a software project. I think we really need to make decisions early and also communicate a lot between team members.

### Date

19 October 2022

### What I completed today

I completed the draft version of the wireframes for the Ruach Elohim foundation. And sent it to the team for feedback and modifications.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

I was a bit lost with what kind of content to put in the wireframes.

### Actions taken

I just put placeholder text or lorim ipsum and basic shapes for icons, images and logos.

### Smart goal for the next day

- Get some feedback and begin to modify the wireframes.
- Set up the MongoDB Atlas database for the project

### Personal reflection

I think I need to start to slowly learn some Advanced JavaScript on the side to master the language.

- I was a little bit distracted with trying to fix my desktop computer as a backup machine just in case my laptop failed. Discovered that the expensive graphics card was dead. So I pulled it out and used the motherboards graphics instead.
- I've started to notice that my laptop is slowing down a lot and will need to prepare my desktop computer for this project.

### Actions taken

Begin transitioning my files over to the desktop and install all the software needed to get up and running.

### Smart goal for the next day

Look again at the assessment and check what else needs to be done.

## 05 Daily Status report 21/10/2022<a name="05daily"></a>

### Date

21 October 2022

### What I completed today

- I completed the Team Contract
- I completed the draft Wireframes for the landing page

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

- When I was designing the wireframes in Photoshop is was very sluggish and took too long.
- Brayden suggested using Figma and it was a better solution as the whole team can add their changes.

### Actions taken

Decided to move all the wireframes to Figma online app and it was a lot faster to design things.

### Smart goal for the next day

- Begin working on the other page designs for the wireframes
- Begin working on the mockups and look at some colour schemes

### Personal reflection

- Communication is really important and daily stand-up meetings really help with progress.
- What doesn't work well is having to learn something new all the time especially if you have a deadline.
- We were down one team member for a couple of days but what I've learned is, you have embrace change and have knowledge in all areas of a project in order to be flexible.

## Individual Reflective Journal for the Software Project Proposal<a name="01proposal"></a>

### 1. Summary of personal contributions:

#### The tasks I completed

The tasks I completed were:

TEAM CONTRACT

I worked on the Team Contract and set that up for the Team to sign.

<img src="img/TeamContractEvidence.jpg" width="900">

WIREFRAMES

Desktop

<img src="img/Wireframes-desktop-finished.jpg" width="900">

Mobile

<img src="img/mobile-wireframes.jpg" width="900">

Tablet

<img src="img/tablet-wireframes.jpg" width="900">

DATABASE

I completed the task of setting up the MongoDB Atlas database for the software project web application.

<img src="img/MongoDB-Atlas-database.jpg" width="900">

### 2. One design commentary:

#### Explanation of one design feature in each app that I contributed to (three in total). And the evidence of my contribution.

Design feature in the Website application that I contributed to were:

WIREFRAMES

I worked on some draft version of the landing page wireframes for the Ruach Elohim Foundation website in Photoshop. I sent the wireframes to the team for feedback and for modifications.

<img src="img/Wireframes-photoshop.jpg" width="900">

I modified the landing page draft wireframes by adding login or account link in the navigation bar.
We decided to move all the designs from Photoshop to online app, Figma for collaboration and live feedback. As that was much easier for us as a team to comment and quickly get feedback on the UI/UX designs.

<img src="img/Wireframes-transfer-to-figma.jpg" width="900">

Completed the rest of the wireframes for desktop. Then after completing the desktop version I struggled to design the mobile versions. So I though of sketching the mobile versions as it was quicker and much easier to do than in Figma.

<img src="img/Wireframes-desktop-finished.jpg" width="900">

So I started sketching out the mobile design by using the desktop as a guide. It was much more difficult to do as there was very little space to work with.

<img src="img/01-Wireframes-REF.jpg" width="900">

<img src="img/02-Wireframes-REF.jpg" width="900">

Creating the mobile versions of the wireframes took a lot longer than I thought. I found I had to extend the frame of the mobile down longer to accommodate the shift of the layout to a column structure. I also left out a lot of images as I know that on mobile images can eat up a lot of data.

Completed mobile wireframes. I chose to use just black, white and gray to only focus on the design aspects and the UI/UX elements.

<img src="img/mobile-wireframes.jpg" width="900">

Now after completing the mobile wireframes, I got to designing the tablet wireframes. It was a lot easier as I had a fair idea of what the UI/UX will look like for a tablet as I was familiar with both desktop and mobile.

<img src="img/tablet-wireframes.jpg" width="900">

### 3. A Reflection on the Teamwork:

#### What went well

What went well with the team was how easy it was to just allocate the tasks that we needed to do for the project. What also went well was the whole team was available and the team didn’t have any other commitments like work. We really had a team that was positive and approached the tasks by volunteering themselves. Communication was responsive in the teams chat and our meetings were really productive and positive. We all gave each other feedback on our work and also supported each other by looking over each other’s work.

#### What issues were met and how they were resolved

**1 ISSUE**

What issues were met during the project was that one of our team members had a family issue to deal with. It was right after we started the project and for a few days we had to continue on with the tasks with one team member missing. It really slowed us down and we just couldn’t finish the tasks fast enough.

**1 RESOLUTION**

How we solved the issue of the missing team member was we took on more tasks. Also we recorded our meetings and kept records of our plans for the missing team member to be able update themselves quickly once they decide to get back to the project.

**2 ISSUE**
Another issue we had was the client was on the other side of the world and spoke in another language. Our only way to contact the client was through one of our team members who spoke and understood the language. A meeting with the client would be difficult because of the difference in time zones.

**2 RESOLUTION**
How we solved the issue with the client was the team decided to communicate to the client through the team member that spoke the language.

#### What could be improved next time.

What could be improved next time would be, to create a contingency plan for unexpected issues like an absent team member. We could have created a risk management system document to outline all the possible risks and create a plan to mitigate each of those risks.

### 4. A reflection on how this project can address some sustainability, equity, social or contemporary cultural issues. Possible issues to touch upon may include; Sustainable travel, Preserving cultural traditions, Designing products for sustainability;

#### The social issues the solution addresses

**SOCIAL ISSUE**

The social issues that we addressed was the rise of deliberate baby dumping in Namibia. A serious social issue of mothers with unplanned pregnancies or unwanted babies to choose to dump or kill their own babies.

**SOLUTION**

The solution for the issue was to create awareness and to prevent unsafe baby dumping through the creation of a website. The website was also a way to also help raise funds via donations and also an avenue for people to donate goods to the foundation.

- I completed the task of finishing the prototypes for Wireframes and prototypes in figma.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

- I had to learn how to use components and variants in figma to get the prototype working on mobile menu.

### Actions taken

- watched a tutorial about how to implement components and variants in figma.

### Smart goal for the next day

- Learn reactJS and NodeJS and back-end development

### Personal reflection

- What went well today was learning some new things in figma
- What didn't go well was it took up a lot of time to learn figma
- What I can improve is take notes and keep learning.

### Date

### What I completed today

### Personal reflection
