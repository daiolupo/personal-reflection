## 01 Daily Status report 17/10/2022

### Date

17 October 2022

### What I completed today

I worked on the Team Contract and setting it up for the team.

### Any issues preventing you from progressing

I was distracted with finding other possible idea's for the software project. A game of some sort might be useful but it could be a waste of time.

### Actions taken

I had to brainstorm some idea's about a game that could be in support of the website.

### Smart goal for the next day

Begin to select collaboration tools appropriate for the team.

### Personal reflection

There was a bit of a delay in the project as we were still trying to come up with an idea for a software project. I think we really need to make decisions early and also communicate a lot between team members.
